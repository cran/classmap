Description: Tools to visualize the results of a classification obtained by discriminant analysis,
    k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines, for two or more classes.
    Implements the techniques described and illustrated in
    Raymaekers, Rousseeuw and Hubert (2021),
    Class maps for visualizing classification results, Technometrics, to appear.
    In addition to class maps, also stacked plots are made. Examples can be found in the vignettes:
    "Discriminant_analysis_examples","K_nearest_neighbors_examples" and
    "Support_vector_machine_examples".
