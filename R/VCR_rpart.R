  # Constructs vcr output from an rpart object.
  #
  # Arguments:
  # X        : A rectangular matrix or data frame, where the
  #            columns (bvariables) may be of mixed type and
  #            may contain NA's.
  # y        : factor with the given class labels.
  #            It is crucial that X and y are EXACTLY the same
  #            as in the call to rpart().
  #            Since rpart() allows y to contain NA's, we do too.
  #            If _all_ entries of y are NA we stop with a message,
  #            but in that situation rpart() crashes anyway.
  # k        : the number of nearest neighbors used in the
  #            farness computation.
  # trainfit : the output of an rpart() training cycle
  # other arguments: development
  #
  # Values include:
  #   yint        : given labels as integer 1, 2, 3, ...
  #   y           : given labels
  #   levels      : levels of y
  #   predint     : predicted class number. For each case this
  #                 is the class with the highest mixture density.
  #   pred        : predicted label of each object.
  #   altint      : competing class as integer, i.e. the non-given
  #                 class number with the highest mixture density.
  #   altlab      : competing class of each object.
  #   PAC         : PAC of each object
  #   farness     : farness of each object to its given class
  #   ofarness    : For each object i, its lowest farness to any
  #                 class (including its own).
